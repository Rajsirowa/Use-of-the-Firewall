🖥️ 1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool (Windows Firewall)

    Press Windows + R, type: wf.msc, hit Enter
    (This opens Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security)

📋 2. List Current Firewall Rules

    In the left pane, click Inbound Rules

    Scroll to view existing rules (you can sort by Port or Name for easier navigation)

🚫 3. Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)

    In Inbound Rules, click New Rule (right-side pane)

    Select Port → Click Next

    Choose TCP, type 23 → Click Next

    Select Block the connection → Click Next

    Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public) → Click Next

    Name the rule: e.g., "Block Telnet Port 23" → Click Finish

🧪 4. Test the Rule (Telnet)

    Install Telnet Client (if not installed):

        Open Command Prompt as Administrator → type:

    dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient

Test the blocked connection:

    telnet localhost 23

        You should get "Connecting To localhost...Could not open connection to the host"

🔐 5. (Optional for Linux): Allow SSH on Port 22

    Not required for Windows. Skip if working only on Windows.

🗑️ 6. Remove the Block Rule

    Go to Inbound Rules

    Find "Block Telnet Port 23"

    Right-click → Delete

📝 7. Document GUI Steps Used

**Windows Firewall Configuration (GUI Steps)**

1. Opened firewall tool via `wf.msc`
2. Listed rules under "Inbound Rules"
3. Created new rule:
   - Type: Port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 23
   - Action: Block
4. Tested using: `telnet localhost 23`
5. Removed rule after testing

🧠 8. Summary: How Firewalls Filter Traffic

A firewall filters traffic by examining incoming and outgoing packets based on rules. These rules consider:

    IP addresses

    Ports

    Protocols

Inbound rules protect the system from external threats.
Outbound rules restrict or monitor data leaving your machine.

In this task, blocking port 23 (Telnet) demonstrates how firewalls help prevent unsecure access, while allowing port 22 (SSH) ensures secure remote communication on Linux.
